# M3SC Courseworks 3: Networks

Project 2: ‘Networks’ completed for ‘Scientific Computing’ module. All code has been written in Python.

In the file `p1.py`, the function `scheduler` is a program which efficiently schedules tasks using a dependency list provided as input. The function `findPath` is a modified implementation of breadth first search which is used to search for a feasible path for successful propagation of a signal from two given nodes in a network. The function a0min computes the minimum initial amplitude needed for a signal to be able to successfully propagate from to given nodes in the network. A detailed description of the implementation, time complexity and efficiency is given for each function in the docstring. 

File `p2.py` simulates a simplified infection model and is used to investigate the similarities and differences between the resulting dynamics and linear diffusion on Barabasi-Albert graphs.
